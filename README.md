# simple-tweets

This project demonstrates a basic Web3 use case. It is based on the Buildspace wave-contract. 
It comes with a sample contract, a script that deploys that contract and a front-end.

As always, NPM install. 

Try running some of the following tasks:

- Run the contract locally using 'npx hardhat run scripts/run.js'
- Deploy the contract on a test network 'npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js (currently set to Goerli in hardhat.config)

# This should be in your .env file
```shell
API_KEY_URL=YOUR_NODE_API_KEY (alchemy, infura etc...)
PRIVATE_KEY=YOUR_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY
```
